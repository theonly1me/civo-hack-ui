## Inspiration
We love tech and to automate mundane tasks with the help of tech. We want to make it possible for everyone to be able to do the same at the comfort of their homes.

## What it does
Allows users to register and control their smart devices or even turn non-smart devices to smart devices via microcontrollers

## How we built it
ES32 Microcontroller, React Front-end, Elixir (Phoenix) backend and PostgreSQL db. The backend is deployed on CIVO.

## Challenges we ran into
Planning for scalability and ease of use

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we were able to build something this fun to use.

## What we learned
We learned how we could turn ideas into products and we also learned about CIVO's cloud offerings

## What's next for Home Smart Home (H2S)
Next is making our app available for a lot of users for free
